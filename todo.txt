# Project Idea

We are a team of two MERN stack developers participating in a hackathon, working on a project that integrates blockchain technology into a React Native (Expo) application. Our project enables users to anonymously report drug dealers and drug users, forwarding these reports to the appropriate authorities. Additionally, we are implementing a gamification system that allows reporters to earn rewards through MetaMask for their contributions.
